shotwell-move-photo-dir
=======================

A script for modifying the Shotwell database (~/.shotwell/data/photo.db) if you
move your photo directory, yet want to keep all of your Shotwell metadata
intact. Specifically if your photo library is large, re-importing it all --
sans-metadata -- into Shotwell is a pain in the ass (e.g. my last two years of
photos alone weigh in at ~30GB).
